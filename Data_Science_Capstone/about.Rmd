This Text Prediction Shiny App simulates text prediction via Natural Language Processing, as found in smartphone keyboard apps, and is my submission for the Coursera / Johns Hopkins University Data Science Capstone project.

In order to predict the next word inputted, the algorithm matches words, in combinations of one through three words, with example text from twitter, blogs, and news sources.

The code for this Text Prediction App is found at: https://github.com/johnakwei/Coursera/TextPredictionApp.
