### Developing Data Products Project
This is the documentation of my Data Product for the Data Science Specialization course from Johns Hopkins University, and Coursera:

1) Shiny application at http://johnakwei1.shinyapps.io/CourseProject.
2) Documentation of the application, located at the application page.
3) The server.R and ui.R code at this github repository.
4) A 5-page R Presentation pitch for the app, (w/ embedded code). Location: www.rpubs.com/johnakwei.

#### My Data Product
The project is titled "Community Demographic Health Status".

The application gives Communities information about local health risks in order to determine if policies are needed to counter an adverse health risks assessment, or to determine the effectiveness of policies currently in place, or to determine if the traditional health risks status of the community is in need of any policy changes.

Select State and County to display Population Density, a graph of County Demographics, an assessment of Population Density and Poverty Rate, and graphs of local health risk levels, average State health risk levels, and average USA health risk levels.

#### Source of the Data
The data is from "Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to Combat Obesity, Heart Disease and Cancer", located at "http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/community-health-status-indicators-chsi-to-combat-obesity-heart-disease-and-cancer". The downloaded files were in .xls and .csv formats.

Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to combat obesity, heart disease, and cancer are major components of the Community Health Data Initiative. This dataset provides key health indicators for local communities and encourages dialogue about actions that can be taken to improve community health (e.g., obesity, heart disease, cancer). The CHSI report and dataset was designed not only for public health professionals but also for members of the community who are interested in the health of their community. The CHSI report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. Although CHSI presents indicators like deaths due to heart disease and cancer, it is imperative to understand that behavioral factors such as obesity, tobacco use, diet, physical activity, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior and others substantially contribute to these deaths.

#### User Instructions
The app has two panels:
The Left Side Panel has user controls for selection of State and County.

The Main Panel provides Community Health information.

#### Application Source Code
The Shiny app consists of R code in two files:
ui.R
server.R
